# Car_Insurance_Churn_Prediction
This project is intended to predict target sales call customers.
Insurance companies around the world operate in a very competitive environment. With various aspects of data collected from millions of customers, it is painstakingly hard to analyse and understand the reason for a customerâ€™s decision to switch to a different insurance provider.
For an industry where customer acquisition and retention are equally important, and the former being a more expensive process, insurance companies rely on data to understand customer behavior to prevent retention. Thus knowing whether a customer is possibly going to switch beforehand gives Insurance companies an opportunity to come up with strategies to prevent it from actually happening.
